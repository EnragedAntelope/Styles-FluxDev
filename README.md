# Styles-FluxDev
Image gallery of styles for FluxDev

This is intended to identify styles that are incorporated into base Flux Dev. It is not a comprehensive list. Additionally, some of the generated prompts show that Flux recognizes the style, but better prompting might have applied it to the whole image potentially. 

All images were generated using ComfyUI (https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and Flux.1 Dev (https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) at fp8-e4m3fn weights, with FP16 T5XXL encoder weights.
IPNDM sampler, Beta scheduler, 50 steps

Styles were produced using Mile High Styler (https://github.com/TripleHeadedMonkey/ComfyUI_MileHighStyler).
